Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Auth::Basic.

Time zone is GMT+2.

1.02 Sun Nov  7 05:27:49 2004
	=> Changed default CHMOD value to 0777 (it was 0644).
	   It must be 0666, but I think that 0777 is mostly 
	   better for CGI apps.
	=> Updated pod.
	=> Fixed typo in error messages.
	=> Added module version info to fatal html.

1.01 Tue Aug 31 16:14:39 2004

	   some hidden areas globally in the templates.
	   They'll also be used in the query strings.
	=> New method exit_code() to set the exit code.
	   Default is CORE::exit.
1.0 Sat Feb 21 16:12:56 2004
